    "## 1.3 How HuBERT Works\n",
    "\n",
    "HuBERT (Hidden Unit BERT) is a fascinating model that applies BERT-style pre-training to speech. Let's understand its clever approach!\n",
    "\n",
    "![HuBERT Overview](https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/illustrated-hubert/hubert_explained.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source: [Jonathan Bgn - HuBERT Visually Explained](https://jonathanbgn.com/2021/10/30/hubert-visually-explained.html)*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Idea: Discovering \"Hidden Units\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: **Speech needs to be converted into discrete units (like words in text) before applying BERT!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Unlike text (which already has discrete words/tokens), raw audio is continuous. How do we create discrete units?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Use clustering! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Clustering to Create Pseudo-Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "HuBERT uses **K-means clustering** to group similar audio segments (25ms each) into K clusters. Each cluster becomes a \"hidden unit\" - think of it as discovering the phonetic alphabet of speech automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "![HuBERT Clustering](https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/illustrated-hubert/hubert_clustering.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Clustering process: Audio segments are grouped into K clusters, creating discrete labels*\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Take raw audio and split into 25ms segments\n",
    "2. Extract features (MFCCs for first iteration, later use learned representations)\n",
    "3. Apply K-means to assign each segment to a cluster\n",
    "4. Each cluster ID becomes a \"target label\" for that audio segment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-iteration refinement:**\n",
    "- **1st iteration**: Use MFCC features for clustering (handcrafted features)\n",
    "- **2nd iteration**: Use representations from 6th transformer layer (learned features)\n",
    "- **3rd iteration** (LARGE/X-LARGE): Use 9th layer representations (even better!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration produces better \"hidden units\" as the model learns more sophisticated representations!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Masked Prediction (Like BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have discrete labels from clustering, we train exactly like BERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "![HuBERT Prediction](https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/illustrated-hubert/hubert_pretraining_prediction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prediction step: Mask ~50% of inputs, predict their cluster assignments from context*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training process:**\n",
    "1. **Mask**: Hide ~50% of the audio frames\n",
    "2. **Predict**: Model predicts cluster assignments for masked positions\n",
    "3. **Learn**: Use cross-entropy loss (simple and stable!)\n",
    "4. **Key trick**: Only compute loss on masked positions (handles noisy labels better)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why HuBERT is Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages over Wav2Vec2:**\n",
    "- **Simpler loss**: Cross-entropy vs contrastive + diversity loss\n",
    "- **More stable training**: No temperature tuning needed\n",
    "- **Better targets**: Re-uses learned representations for clustering\n",
    "- **Matches or beats Wav2Vec2** on speech recognition!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The iterative magic:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Iteration 1: MFCC → Clustering → Train → Get basic representations\n",
    "                              ↓\n",
    "Iteration 2: Layer 6 features → Better clustering → Train → Get better representations  \n",
    "                              ↓\n",
    "Iteration 3: Layer 9 features → Even better clustering → Train → Best representations!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration discovers more meaningful \"hidden units\" - from crude phonetic categories to fine-grained acoustic patterns!"
